# Trello-Testing-Project
This is a project of Selenium WebDriver Automated Testing for Trello Web Application

* The aim of this project is to evaluate the overall functionality, performance, and reliability of the Trello website. We apply various types of testing methods including  manual testing, API testing, load and stress testing, and automation testing. Our goal is  to detect any issues that may impact the user experience, performance bottlenecks, and areas for improvement, ensuring that the Trello platform satisfies high quality, reliability, and usability standards.
 
    ***The testing approaches adopted for this project include:
1-Manual Testing :Test cases are tracked, bugs are identified, and defects are monitored using Jira and AIO Tests.

2-API testing :Verified Trello's API endpoints for functionality, performance, and security using Postman.

3-Performance Load & Stress Testing :To identify Trello's breaking point, both load and stress tests were conducted to determine how well it handled different levels of user activity using Jmeter.

4-Automation Test:Developed automated test scripts using Java and Selenium to ensure the website's critical functionalities are consistent and reliable.
